# Agent Behavior

- Use the fail-fast principle: stop on invalid assumptions rather than continuing in a degraded or misleading state; only add fallbacks when explicitly approved in designs or architecture.
- When asked for a plan, write a SPEC.
- Never delete changes you didn't make or don't recognize; assume concurrent edits by other instances and continue with your task.
- Use Excalidraw format for any diagrams you output.
