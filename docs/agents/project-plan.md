# Project Plan and Progress

- The current implementation plan and product scope live in `PLAN.md`. Keep it up-to-date as decisions change during development.
- Progress/audit trail lives in `PROGRESS.toml`. Treat it as append-only and historical.
- After completing a canonical task from `PLAN.md`, append a record to `PROGRESS.toml` describing what was completed, the challenges/decisions, and tests run.
